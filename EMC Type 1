# EMC Type 1 Controller

### Purpose
The EMC Type 1 is designed as a hydraulic clutch controller for motorcycles, providing both automatic and manual modes of operation. It leverages PID control to maintain user-defined RPM targets, with real-time sensor feedback and user-configurable settings.

### Key Features
1. **Dual Modes of Operation**:
   - **Automatic Mode**: Uses PID control to adjust the clutch position automatically based on RPM feedback.
   - **Manual Mode**: Allows direct user control of the clutch via a potentiometer.

2. **Sensor Input**:
   - RPM sensing via a digital pulse train.
   - Potentiometer inputs for both automatic and manual modes.

3. **Real-time Feedback**:
   - LED indicators for system status (armed/disarmed).
   - Serial commands for user interaction and control.

4. **Configurable PID Control**:
   - Supports user-defined PID constants (Kp, Ki, Kd) for precise control.
   - Target RPM is adjustable via serial commands.

5. **Servo Control**:
   - Controls a servo motor to adjust the clutch position.
   - Output mapped from PID calculations or manual potentiometer input.

### Serial Commands
- **setrpm <value>**: Set the target RPM.
- **setpid <kp> <ki> <kd>**: Configure PID constants.
- **arm**: Switch to automatic mode.
- **disarm**: Switch to manual mode.
- **status**: Display current system status.
- **help**: Show available commands.

### System Overview
The EMC Type 1 is built on an Arduino Uno and uses interrupt-driven RPM sensing, making it highly responsive. It provides a serial interface for communication, enabling easy configuration and monitoring. With its dual-mode functionality, the system is adaptable to various user needs, offering both automated control for precision and manual control for flexibility.
